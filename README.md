Here is where I will be answering React questions to help me in my endeavors, but also as a study guide to assist me in interviews!

1. What is React?
React is an open-source Javascript library developed and maintained by Google, created in 2013. React helps create quickly responsive and dynamic web applications (React Native for mobile applications). React is built on using components to organize and allows for flexibility when creating the architecture for the project.

2. React vs Angular?

3. What is JSX?
JSX is a new "dialect" of Javascript code that will embed HTML elements into JS code. You do not need to use JSX to write an application in React, however using it helps. 

4. What are stateless components?
They are functions that render the DOM solely based on the properties assigned to them. There is no need for internal state and the output of the component will strictly be the output of the function.
